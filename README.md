# Open Data Structures (in Rust)

Open Data Structures is a textbook and source list about data structures. You can review them here [Open Data Structures](https://opendatastructures.org/).  
This is the Rust version of Open Data Structures. 

Note: *This repository exists for my study. I've read up to 4 chapters and am in the process of implementing it up to the skiplist for now.*

The following is a list of data structures that have been implemented in Rust.
